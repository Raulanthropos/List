# List
 ### This is a simple app with one button, we will have no server and no data to serve to the user. We are simply going to focus on the bare minimum functionalities: adding a list item to an arbitrary list, and clearing the input field for potential new additions. Then display the result, and use it for the next operation.

# Requirements
#### Create the layout:

Layout is as simple as it could be. Centered elements, being a header, an input field and a button, with much space on the bottom for the list items to be displayed.

#### Software design:

Once the user finishes inputting the list item, they can click the button to add it to their list. For better UX, user can alternatively simply press the "Enter" key for the same result.
